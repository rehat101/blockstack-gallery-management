## Custom manifest loader

I have built a custom manifest loader via webpack which takes url options and creates a production-ready manifest file for you. 

_Please note: Use this loader only on your production config_

```javascript 
const manifestLoader = {
  test: /manifest.json$/,
  loader: path.resolve('./manifest-loader/index'),
  options: {
    production: {
      start_url: 'production-url.com',
      icon_src: 'https://produciton-url.com/icon.png'
    }
  }
};
```
